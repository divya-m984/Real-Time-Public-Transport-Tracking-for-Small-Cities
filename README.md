# Transit Live India

> A passenger journey-search demo for Chennai, Mumbai, and Delhi — powered by simulated real-time bus data.
> Built as a student/portfolio project using Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, Leaflet.js, and vanilla JavaScript.

**All route, stop, and vehicle data is simulated for educational and portfolio demonstration only.
Not affiliated with MTC, BEST, DTC, DMRC, MMRDA, CUMTA, or any official transport authority.**

---

## What it does

Passengers enter a **From** stop and a **To** stop, press **Find Buses**, and see every direct route
that connects those two stops — including live bus positions and approximate ETAs.
The map draws the relevant route segments and highlights the origin and destination stops.
Only buses on matching routes appear; the map is blank before a search.

---

## Features

- Searchable combobox dropdowns for stop selection (keyboard-navigable: ↑ ↓ Enter Escape)
- Swap button to instantly reverse origin and destination
- Direct-route matching: a route matches only when the origin stop appears before the destination stop in its ordered stop list
- Return-direction routes auto-generated at startup — searching Koyambedu → Central shows buses travelling in that direction
- Live bus markers on the map, filtered to matched routes only, updated every 2–4 s via Socket.IO
- Approximate ETA displayed per bus: distance to boarding stop divided by reported speed (labelled "approx, simulated")
- Occupancy indicator per bus: Low / Medium / High
- Map draws route-segment polylines and green (origin) / red (destination) circle markers; auto-fits bounds
- Three-city support: Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi — independent stop lists, routes, socket rooms, and map centres
- City selection persisted to `localStorage`; defaults to Chennai
- Connection status pill with offline/reconnecting banner
- No build step — frontend served as static files by the same Express server

## Supported Cities

| City    | Map Centre         | Routes | Stops | Buses (simulated) | Bus ID prefix |
|---------|--------------------|--------|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| Chennai | 13.0827, 80.2707   | 4      | 17    | 8                 | CHE-          |
| Mumbai  | 19.0760, 72.8777   | 5      | 15    | 10                | MUM-          |

## Architecture

```
Simulator  --POST /api/update-->  Express backend  --Socket.IO room-->  Browser
(every 2–4 s,                     validates + stores                    journey search UI
 city-prefixed bus IDs)            per-city in memory                   (Leaflet + vanilla JS)

Browser  --GET /api/journeys-->  Express backend  --OSRM route API-->  router.project-osrm.org
(on Find Buses press)             matches routes,                       returns road-following
                                  fetches road geometry,                GeoJSON LineString
                                  calculates ETAs,
                                  returns journey list + routeGeometry
```

1. The **backend** loads `data/cities.json` at startup, reads each city's stop file and route file,
   and auto-generates a return route for every forward route.
2. The **simulator** moves buses along predefined stop sequences, bounces at each terminus, and
   POSTs position updates (including `cityId`) to `POST /api/update`.
3. The **frontend** calls `GET /api/stops` to populate the comboboxes when a city is selected.
4. On **Find Buses**, the frontend calls `GET /api/journeys`; the backend:
   - Finds all direct routes connecting the two stops.
   - For each matching route, fetches a road-following geometry from OSRM covering only the
     ordered stops between origin and destination.
   - Returns the journey list, ETAs, and a `routeGeometry` field per journey.
5. The **frontend** draws a Leaflet polyline using the road-following coordinates.
   GeoJSON coordinates (`[lon, lat]`) are flipped to Leaflet order (`[lat, lon]`) in the client.
6. Live `locationUpdate` events arrive via Socket.IO and move bus markers — but only for routes
   returned by the last journey search.

### Road routing services

```
backend/services/
  road-routing-service.js   — calls OSRM, manages in-memory geometry cache
  route-shape-service.js    — selects best geometry source (GTFS → OSRM → fallback)
```

`route-shape-service.js` uses the following priority:

| Priority | Source | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Official GTFS `shapes.txt` | Placeholder — returns null until real data is integrated |
| 2 | OSRM road geometry | Active — fetched from `OSRM_BASE_URL` and cached in memory |
| 3 | Stop-connection fallback | Used when OSRM is unreachable; straight lines between stops |

> **Important limitation**: OSRM generates a *driving* route through the stop coordinates.
> This is a road-network approximation and is **not** the official bus route alignment.
> The generated shape is labelled internally as "Road-network demonstration route" and
> `isOfficial: false` in the API response.

#### Replacing generated road routing with official GTFS data

When official `shapes.txt` data becomes available for MTC (Chennai), BEST (Mumbai), or
DTC/DIMTS (Delhi), implement the `getGtfsShape()` function in
`backend/services/route-shape-service.js`.  That function should:

1. Resolve the `shape_id` for the given `routeId` from the GTFS feed.
2. Clip the shape to the `fromStopId` → `toStopId` segment.
3. Return a GeoJSON `LineString` geometry with `distanceMeters` and `durationSeconds`.

Once `getGtfsShape()` returns a non-null result it automatically takes priority over the OSRM
path.  No other changes are needed.

Official GTFS feeds for Indian cities:
- MTC Chennai: https://data.open-transit.in/ (check current availability)
- BEST Mumbai:  BEST Undertaking open data portal
- DTC Delhi:    data.gov.in

## How to Run

You need **two terminal windows**. The backend serves the frontend automatically.

### Terminal 1 — Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
# Starts on http://localhost:3000
# Also serves frontend/index.html at http://localhost:3000/
```

### Terminal 2 — Simulator

```bash
cd simulator
npm install

# All three cities — 28 buses (default)
CITY=all node simulator.js

# Single city
CITY=chennai node simulator.js   #  8 buses
CITY=mumbai  node simulator.js   # 10 buses
CITY=delhi   node simulator.js   # 10 buses
```

### Browser

Open **http://localhost:3000/** — no separate file server needed.

> If the connection badge shows "Connecting", ensure the backend is running first.

---

## Data Schemas

### City config — `data/cities.json`

```json
{
  "id":            "chennai",
  "name":          "Chennai",
  "label":         "Chennai Transit Live",
  "mapCenter":     [13.0827, 80.2707],
  "defaultZoom":   12,
  "routeDataFile": "chennai-routes.json",
  "stopsDataFile": "chennai-stops.json",
  "referenceStop": {
    "name": "Chennai Central",
    "lat":  13.0827,
    "lon":  80.2707
  }
}
```

### Canonical stop — `data/{city}-stops.json`

```json
{
  "stopId": "CHE-STOP-CENTRAL",
  "cityId": "chennai",
  "name":   "Chennai Central",
  "lat":    13.0827,
  "lon":    80.2707
}
```

Stop IDs follow the pattern `{PREFIX}-STOP-{NAME}`:
`CHE-STOP-*` for Chennai, `MUM-STOP-*` for Mumbai, `DEL-STOP-*` for Delhi.

### Forward route — `data/{city}-routes.json`

```json
{
  "routeId":     "CHN-01",
  "cityId":      "chennai",
  "routeName":   "Central Connect",
  "routeNumber": "12C",
  "direction":   "outbound",
  "color":       "#e53935",
  "stopIds": [
    "CHE-STOP-CENTRAL",
    "CHE-STOP-EGMORE",
    "CHE-STOP-KILPAUK",
    "CHE-STOP-ANNA-NAGAR",
    "CHE-STOP-KOYAMBEDU"
  ],
  "stops": [
    { "stopId": "CHN01-01", "name": "Chennai Central", "lat": 13.0827, "lon": 80.2707 },
    { "stopId": "CHN01-02", "name": "Egmore",          "lat": 13.0784, "lon": 80.2618 }
  ]
}
```

- **`stopIds`** — ordered array of canonical stop IDs used for journey matching.
- **`stops`** — route-scoped stop objects with coordinates; used by the simulator and for map polylines.

The backend auto-generates a return route at startup for each forward route by reversing both arrays.
Return routes have `routeId` suffixed with `R` (e.g. `CHN-01R`) and `direction: "return"`.

| POST | `/api/update` | Receive a bus position from the simulator |

### GET `/api/journeys` — response shape

```json
{
  "cityId":   "chennai",
  "fromStop": { "stopId": "CHE-STOP-ADYAR", "name": "Adyar", "lat": 13.0012, "lon": 80.2565 },
  "toStop":   { "stopId": "CHE-STOP-THIRUVANMIYUR", "name": "Thiruvanmiyur", ... },
  "journeys": [
    {
      "routeId":              "CHN-03",
      "routeNumber":          "70M",
      "routeName":            "Airport Express Demo",
      "direction":            "outbound",
      "color":                "#00897b",
      "boardingStopIndex":    4,
      "destinationStopIndex": 5,
      "intermediateStopCount": 0,
      "intermediateStops":    [],
      "routeSegmentStops":    [ ...stop objects for this segment... ],
      "activeBuses": [
        {
          "busId":          "CHE-106",
          "lat":            13.0012,
          "lon":            80.2565,
          "nextStop":       "Thiruvanmiyur",
          "speedKmph":      25,
          "occupancyLevel": "Low",
          "timestamp":      "2026-07-11T14:09:05.123Z",
          "etaMinutes":     0,
          "etaLabel":       "Arriving soon"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Journeys are sorted: most active buses first, then fewest intermediate stops.
Active buses within a journey are sorted by ascending ETA (buses with unknown positions last).

`etaLabel` values: `"Arriving soon"`, `"~N min (approx, simulated)"`, or `"ETA unavailable"`.

### POST `/api/update` — request body

```json
{
  "cityId":         "mumbai",
  "busId":          "MUM-101",
  "lat":            19.0190,
  "lon":            72.8420,
  "routeId":        "MUM-R1",
  "speedKmph":      32,
  "nextStop":       "Bandra",
  "occupancyLevel": "Medium"
}
```

`routeId`, `speedKmph`, `nextStop`, and `occupancyLevel` are optional.
Returns `400` when `cityId` is missing/unsupported, `busId` is empty, `lat`/`lon` are not finite numbers,
or `routeId` is provided but not known for that city.

## Current Limitations

- **Direct routes only** — no transfer routing. If no single route connects the two stops, the result is empty.
- **In-memory vehicle state** — bus positions are lost when the backend restarts. There is no database.
- **No real-time feeds** — all vehicle positions are produced by the simulator. No GTFS-Realtime or official agency API is connected.
- **Simulated coordinates** — stop coordinates are approximate landmark positions, not surveyed stop locations.
- **ETA is approximate** — calculated from Haversine distance and reported speed; traffic, dwell time, and signal delays are not modelled.

---

## Planned Roadmap

- [ ] GTFS static feed import — replace hand-authored JSON with real schedule data
- [ ] GTFS-Realtime adapter — plug in live vehicle positions when an agency API is available
- [ ] Transfer routing — find journeys that require one change
- [ ] Persistent vehicle state — store positions in Redis or SQLite so restarts do not lose data
- [ ] Stop arrival predictions — use historical dwell and travel times
- [ ] Admin endpoint with authentication for bus update ingestion
- [ ] Docker deployment configuration

---

## Adding a City

1. **Add a city entry** to `data/cities.json` following the schema above. Set `routeDataFile` and `stopsDataFile`.

2. **Create a stop file** `data/<city>-stops.json` with a `stops` array. Give each stop a city-prefixed canonical ID (e.g. `HYD-STOP-*`).

3. **Create a route file** `data/<city>-routes.json`. Every route needs:
   - a `stopIds` array referencing the canonical stop IDs (in boarding order)
   - a `stops` array with coordinates (used by the simulator and for map polylines)

4. **No code changes needed** — the backend loads all cities from `cities.json` at startup; the simulator
   includes any new city when `CITY=all`; the frontend generates city tabs dynamically from `/api/cities`.

---

## Configuration

### Backend — `backend/.env`

```
PORT=3000
```

### Simulator — `simulator/.env`

```
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/update
CITY=all
```

Copy `*.env.example` to `*.env` and adjust as needed. Both `PORT` and `BACKEND_URL` can also be
set as shell environment variables.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Connection badge stays "Connecting"**
- Ensure the backend is running: `cd backend && node server.js`
- The frontend expects the backend at `http://localhost:3000`. If you changed the port, update
  `BACKEND_URL` in `frontend/js/main.js` to match.

**Stops combobox is empty after selecting a city**
- The frontend fetches stops from `/api/stops?cityId=<id>` on city switch. Check the backend terminal
  for errors and verify that the city's `stopsDataFile` exists in `data/`.

**No buses appear after searching**
- Start the simulator: `CITY=all node simulator.js` from the `simulator/` directory.
- Bus markers only appear for routes returned by the current search. If no routes matched, no markers appear.

**"No direct route found" when a route should exist**
- Confirm the stop IDs used are canonical `{PREFIX}-STOP-*` IDs (from `GET /api/stops`), not the
  route-scoped `CHN01-01` style IDs found in the route `stops` array.
- A route only matches if `indexOf(fromStopId) < indexOf(toStopId)` in `stopIds`. Try swapping
  origin and destination to search the return direction.

**Simulator exits immediately**
- Check that `data/cities.json` and all referenced route files exist and contain valid JSON.
- Pass `CITY=chennai` to isolate a single city if `CITY=all` fails.

**Backend fails to start**
- Run `npm install` inside `backend/`.
- Verify all JSON files in `data/` parse cleanly: `node -e "require('./data/cities.json')"`.
